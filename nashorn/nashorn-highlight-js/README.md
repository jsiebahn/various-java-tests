Java 8 Nashorn and highlight.js
===============================

Here you find my first try using nashorn to execute JavaScript in Java. To have something that is 
useful I picked [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) from Ivan Sagalaev.

Note that I am NOT the developer of highlight.js and have NO connection to that project. There are
no modifications made to the `highlight.js` source file and the language files. A JavaScript adapter
script and some Java code help to access the `highlight` without modifications. If you like to use 
highlight.js or have any questions about it, please refer to their
[website](https://highlightjs.org/) or 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js).

Obviously this module requires Java 8.
